The evaluation metric for this experiment was used from [(TorchMetrics)](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

1. First of all, according to ·requirement.txt· install dependent library
  
2. use `LunaPrepare or LIDCPrepare`can parpare training data
  
3. use `trainLIDC or trainLuna` can train different models
  
4. use `evaluateLIDC` or `evaluateLuna` can evaluate different models

Note: Note that the segmentation models used in this project are all from github
